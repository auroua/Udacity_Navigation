### This repo is the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning course Navigation Project
> The README should be designed for a general audience that may not be familiar with the Nanodegree program; you should describe the environment that you solved, along with how to install the requirements before running the code in your repository.

##### Steps
1. install python
2. ```pip install pytorch``` reference [pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/)
3. ```pip install unityagents```
4. download **banana env** from [Banana_Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip) and [Banana_Linux_Pixels](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd893/parts/6b0c03a7-6667-4fcf-a9ed-dd41a2f76485/modules/4eeb16ab-5ac5-47bf-974d-12784e9730d7/lessons/69bd42c6-b70e-4866-9764-9bfa8c03cdea/concepts/80164380-a9ad-460d-bee7-59fe2d776036)
5. Run ```Navigation_Env.py``` and ```Navigation_Env_Pixels.py``` to test the environment work all right.
